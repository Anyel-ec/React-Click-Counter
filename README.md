# Click Counter App with React

This is a simple click counter application built with React. It allows users to click a button and keep track of the number of clicks.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the click counter application:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you don't have them, download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Clone or download this repository to your computer.

3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:

   ```bash
   cd click-counter-react-app
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You can click the "Click Me" button to increment the counter. The page will automatically update to display the current count.

## How It Works

The click counter application is built with React and uses state to keep track of the click count. When the button is clicked, the state is updated, and React re-renders the component to display the new count.

The source code for the application is located in the `src` directory, and the primary files include:

- `App.js`: The main component that displays the counter and handles the click event.
- `index.js`: The entry point of the application.
