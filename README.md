## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the click counter application:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you don't have them, download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Clone or download this repository to your computer.

3. In the project directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You can click the "Click Me" button to increment the counter. The page will automatically update to display the current count.

## How It Works

The click counter application is built with React and uses state to keep track of the click count. When the button is clicked, the state is updated, and React re-renders the component to display the new count.

The source code for the application is located in the `src` directory, and the primary files include:

- `App.js`: The main component that displays the counter and handles the click event.
- `index.js`: The entry point of the application.
